name: WATTS
headline: Workflow and Template Toolkit for Simulation
description: |
  WATTS consists of a set of Python classes that can manage simulation workflows
  for one or multiple codes. It provides: an isolated execution environment when
  running a code; the ability to use placeholder values in input files that are
  filled in programmatically; seamless unit conversions when working with
  multiple codes; a managed database that simulation inputs and outputs are
  automatically saved to; and Python classes that provide extra post-processing
  and analysis capabilities.
