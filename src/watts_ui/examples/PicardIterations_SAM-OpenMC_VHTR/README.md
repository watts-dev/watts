# PicardIterations_SAM-OpenMC_VHTR

## Purpose

This example demonstrates how to use WATTS to perform several iterations where SAM calculations are followed by OpenMC calculation and temperature/power information are exchanged until convergence.

## Code(s)
 
- SAM
- OpenMC

## Keywords
 
- Information transfer from SAM to OpenMC
- Picard iterations until convergence
